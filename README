This is an SSL proxy wrapper to encrypt connections between VOD-9.3 server and remote client machines. This script works only if the VOD-9.3 server and client machines have the same RHEL version, also:
server: RHEL6.x <--> RHEL6.x : client
server: RHEL7.x <--> RHEL7.x : client
  
This repository has Three scripts:
1- stunnel_install_pre_requisites.sh -> it installs/upgrades all software required to setup the stunnel wrapper;

2- server/stunnel_server_setup.sh -> it setups the stunnel wrapper on the VOD-9.3 server machine.
You need to have a VOD_9.3 server environment defined on the terminal you call this script.
The name of the wrapper will be partially choosen by the script (you will be required to enter a string set, which will be added to the partial defined name). You will need also to enter a valid port number for the SSL server wrapper and another port number for the client wrapper (this last one will be tested in a single remote client machine).
It will setup and startup the stunnel to run a SSL-server wrapper in daemon mode,  generate a self-signed key and a compressed tar file (this tar file has all configuration necessary to setup a client SSL wrapper and also the self-signed key), which will be saved into the /stc/stunnel directory;

3- client/stunnel_client_setup.sh -> This script should be called in any client machine using as argument the previous compressed tar file generated by the stunnel_server_setup.sh script. In case the SSL wrapper client port is alread in use, then this script will inform you and stop (In this case you need to choose if you are going to remove the service associated with this port on your client machine OR edit the config file into the tar file setting up a different unsed port to this client machine).

OBS: 
I- By default Linux Ephemeral port range lies between [32768 - 61000];
II- The Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) suggests the range 49152 to 65535 (215+214 to 216âˆ’1) for dynamic or private ports (BSD);
III- Try to assign both the server and client ssl wrapper a port number inside the two previous listed ranges.
